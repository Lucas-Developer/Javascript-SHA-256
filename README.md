The SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) is one of the many cryptographic hash functions. It is suggested that SHA256 or greater must used for critical technology. This script is used to process variable length message into a fixed-length output using the SHA256 algorithm. It is fully compatible with UTF-8 encoding.

If you plan using UTF-8 encoding in your project donâ€™t forget to set the page encoding to UTF-8 (Content-Type meta tag).
